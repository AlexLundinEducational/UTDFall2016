1.1
	Personal Computers (PCs)
		- good performance to single user
		- low cost
		- use third party Software
		
	Servers
		- acessed via Network
		- carry large loads
		- wide range of cost and capability
		
	Supercomputers
		- tens of thousands of processors
		- usually terabytes of memory
		
	Embedded Computers
		- largest class of computers
		- microprocessors in cars, TV sets and airplanes
		
1.3
	The developers use a high level language to program. Then the compiler turns this source code into assembly language. 
	Next, the assembler takes the assembly language and transforms this into a binary machine language program.
	
1.4
	8 bits for each of the three colors, so 24 bits per pixel or 3 bytes
	
	frame size of 1280 X 1024 times 3 bytes per pixel
	3,932,160 Bytes
	
	time = frame buffer / network rate
	time = 3.932 Mbits / 100 Mbits per second 
	time = .039 seconds
	
1.5
	a) 	CPU time = (instruction count * CPI) / clock rate 
		P1 = 3 GHz / 1.5 = 2
		P2 = 2.5 GHz / 1.0 = 2.5
		P3 = 4.0 GHz / 2.2 = 1.81 fastest
		
	b)	clock cycles = CPU time * clock rate
		P1 = 10 s * 3 GHz = 30 * 10^9 cycles
		P2 = 10 s * 2.5 GHz = 25 * 10^9 cycles
		P3 = 10 s * 4.0 GHz = 40 * 10^9 cycles
		
		CPU clock cycles / CPI = Instructions
		P1 = 3.0 * 10^9 cycles / 1.5
		P2 = 2.5 * 10^9 cycles / 1.0
		P3 = 4.0 * 10^9 cycles / 2.2
		
	c) 
		Execution time and CPI are inversely related, so changing on effects the other.
		We should use a longer clock rate so the overall run time goes down.
