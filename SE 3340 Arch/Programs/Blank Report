Report Standards
Consider the audience of your report to be your technical manager (who is overseeing dozens of projects). 
You need to inform the manager of the importance and description of your work. 
You need to explain how you proceeded to complete the assignment and describe your solution.

Each report must include at least three sections:
1. Problem statement,
This section should include the explanation of the projects importance as well as a description of the problem in your own words.

2. Approach to solution,
This section should include information such as a verbal description of your design, the languages selected, and the tools used.

3. Solution description.
This section should include information about how to build and execute your solution. 
It is appropriate to include screen captures of the build and execution in this section. 
You should note when you are reusing code and when you needed to write new code. 
You should also make special note of rewriting code to fit the specific needs of this assignment.
Each section shall include at least one paragraph. All paragraphs should include at least three sentences. 
Code shall be kept to a minimum in the report (no more than two lines of code per page). 
Larger code segments should be reserved for appendices. Any tables, charts, graphs, or figures should include at least one paragraph which describes them.
These notes indicate a minimum quality of a report which is worth about half of the report value. Reports should be spelling and grammar error free (run a spelling/grammar checker before submission).
