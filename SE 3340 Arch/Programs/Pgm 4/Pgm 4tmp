# Description of file content - 
# this program askes user for the number of pairs to multiply then accumulate at the end.
# after the total number of pairs is entered, the user must enter each number for the set of pairs.
# these pairs are stored onto the stack, in two seperate arrays starting at different addresses.
# the program pulls each item back off the stack during the multiply loop.
# finally the program outputs the accumulated value.
