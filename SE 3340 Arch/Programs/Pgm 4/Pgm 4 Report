Pgm 4 Report

1.) Problem statement

	This program demstrates how to use registers and syscalls to accumulate values from the user.
	Understanding how to implement a for loop was cruicial to this assignment.
	Learning how MIPS handles loops will build a strong foundation for the final project.

2.) Approach to solution

	I started this assignment by learning how to implement a for loop.
	Next, I set up the structure to iterate based on the input from a user.
	Finally, I created the peices to multiply and accumulate inputs.

3.) Solution Description

	This program uses labels to split up the basic tasks with jump and link calls to return to main.
	First, main prompts the user with information for the type of input expected.
	Next, main calls the read label, with a jump and link instruction, to get the number of pairs from the user.
	This value is used to establish the maximum number of times the loop for inputing pairs repeates.
	The link returns to main.
	After this, the L1 label is called with a jump and link instruction.
	The L1 label repeates until the counter max is reached.
	Each iteration accepts to intergers from the user, multiplies them and adds them to the accumulator.
	Finally, when the max value is reached, EXIT is called.
	Exit prints more information about the process and outputs the final answer.
