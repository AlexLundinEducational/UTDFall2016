Pgm 2 Report

1.) Problem statement

	This program demstrates how to use registers and syscalls to accept integers from the user.
	Understanding these concepts will build the foundation for later assignments.
	Learning arthimetic is crucial to more complex problems.

2.) Approach to solution

	I started this assignment by learning how to use syscall to accept integers from the user.
	Next, I drafted an outline of my labels for what each routine would do.
	Finally, I chose to use the mul instruction to handle the multiplication.
	This is enough to learn the main concept of the assignment and I wanted to capture the limitation of this instruction in my report.
	The mul instruction in my multiplyboth label will not handle overflow.

3.) Solution Description

	This program uses labels to split up the basic tasks with jump and link calls to return to main.
	First, it reads a integer from the user and prints the value, followed by a print newline.
	The program repeats those two steps once more.
	The values are stored in $t0 and $t1.
	Next, both entries are multiplied together and stored to $t2.
	Finally, the result is printed.
	I found the code in the printnewline label online.
