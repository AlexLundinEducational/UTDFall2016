1.) Problem statement:

	This program demstrates how to use registers and syscalls to print strings.
	Understanding these concepts will build the foundation for later assignments.
	Learning sytax and how a language outputs data is paramount to more complex problems.

2.) Approach to solution:

	I started with an example file of MARS source code for outputting a array of Fibonacci numbers.
	After removing the loops to calculate the numbers, I adjusted the output string to be my name.
	I also updated the comments to reflect the changes.

3.) Solution description:

	This program creates a string with the label head to be my name.
	Next the program loads the address of this string into a register.
	Finally, the print service prints the entire string.
	There is a blank syscall at the end for clean output.
